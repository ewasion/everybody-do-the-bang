# EVERYBODY DO THE !BANG

Up-to-date list of DuckDuckGo !bangs for use in [custom](http://nanami-tan.info/#HTMLPage) [start](https://startpages.github.io/)[pages](https://startpages.cf/).

Fetched from [bang_lite](https://duckduckgo.com/bang_lite.html).

[Example of what can be done with this](https://ewasion.github.io/everybody-do-the-bang/).

## Usage

The structure is as follows:

- bangID
  - s (Search URL)
  - h (Homepage URL)
  - n (Human-readable name)

s (and sometimes h) will contain letters surrounded by two curly brackets.  
You need to replace those with a properly encoded search string:
- {{qe}} is for url encoding
- {{qs}} is for replacing spaces with +
